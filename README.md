# JenkinsPipelineGitHubPack

A Jenkinsfile created using the classic UI is stored by Jenkins itself (within the Jenkins home directory).

To create a basic Pipeline through the Jenkins classic UI:

From the Jenkins home page (i.e. the Dashboard of the Jenkins classic UI), click New Item at the top left.

Scroll down and click Pipeline, then click OK at the end of the page to open the Pipeline configuration page (whose General tab is selected).

Enter a name, click Pipeline and then click OK

In the Pipeline section, ensure that the Definition field indicates the Pipeline script option.

Enter your Pipeline code into the Script text area.
